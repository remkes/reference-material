    <title>Academing Writing in Mathematics</title>
    <p>
      Writing a math assignment at the university lebel is a very
      different thing from mathematics writing in K-12 settings
      In this section, I want to give some clear
      expectation on what I expect for academic writing in
      mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of this sections follows from one basic idea.
      <blockquote>
        An assignment is a clear and clean presentation of
        <em>your own</em> arguments and ideas about a set of
        mathematical problems.
      </blockquote>
      I have made this list to elaboriate on the one basic idea.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Your assignments should be clean, legible and well organized.
        Don't hand in work with crossed-out sections or questions out
        of order. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't expect to hand in the paper that your start working
        with.  First work out your solutions in rough; then organize
        your solutions and write up a complete, clear and
        well-structured good copy to hand in. Like all academic work,
        good mathematics involves drafts. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Annotate your calculations and explain your work. A string of
        calculations without any explanation is usually not
        sufficient. In the basic idea, I said that an assignment is
        your <em>argument</em>; arguments require words and sentences,
        not just mathematical symbols.
      </li>
      <li>
        As a starting rule-of-thumb, most first and second year math
        assignments should be roughly 50% calculations and 50% words
        and sentences. 
      </li>
      <li>
        In the writing you do between around your calculations, hold
        yourself to the same standards you would for any academic
        writing. Use complete sentences and strive for clear, concise
        and formal writing. 
      </li>
      <li>
        For the vast majority of your work, you should leave numerical
        answers in exact values. (For example, write <m>\sqrt{5}</m>
        instead of the approximate value <m>2.236</m>.)
      </li>
      <li>
        When you use a computer algebra system or other technical tool
        for calculations, briefly indicate that you've done so. 
      </li>
      <li>
        If you use any external sources, you must reference them. This
        includes online courses, videos, and online discussion boards.
        I am not particular on what reference formatting you use: use
        any of the standard formats. (There is more discussion on
        citing rouses in <xref ref="chapter-academic-honesty" />). 
      </li>
      <li>
        If you use a resource which introduces definitions or solution
        techniques that are different from what we use in this course,
        you need to explain those definitions or techniques and tell
        me why they apply to the question that I assigned. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Collaboration on assignments is strongly encouraged.
        However, you must write up your own version of the assignment
        after you have worked together to figure out a solution.
        Assignemnts from different students which have word-for-word
        identical sentences are not acceptable. 
      </li>
      <li>
        If you collaborated with other students in the course, please
        record who you worked with somewhere on the assignment. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Hand in your assignments when they are due. If a health or
        emergency situation prevents you from finishing your
        assignment, let me know (by email, preferably) as early as
        possible. 
      </li>
      <li>
        For assignments submitted online, if you are working with pen
        and paper, submit a PDF scan of your
        assignment. Almost all mobile devices (phone, tablets) have
        easy ways to use their built-in cameras to scan documents. (I
        will post instruction on the course Moodle site as well).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <title>Examples</title>
    <p>
      To help make these expectations clear, I've produced a number of
      examples. In each of these examples,
      Solution 1 is technically correct but very poorly presented. I
      would not give full marks for this solution. Solution 2
      contains the same technical details, but is much more clearly
      presented and includes references. Solution 2 would be given full
      marks.

          I can solve for <m>x</m> in the first equation.
        </p>
        <me>
          x = 1 - y 
        </me>
        <p>
          Then I put this expression for <m>x</m> into the second
          equation.
        </p>
        <me>
          1 - y + z = 0 
        </me>
        <p>
          Now I can solve for <m>y</m> in this second equation. 
        </p>
        <me>
          y = 1 + z 
        </me>
        <p>
          I can put this expression for <m>y</m> into the third
          equation. 
        </p>
        <me>
          1 + z + z = 2 
        </me>
        <p>
          Now <m>z</m> is the only variable, so I can simply solve for
          it. 
        </p>
        <me>
          z = \frac{1}{2} 
        </me>
        <p>
          I can use this value for <m>z</m> to determine <m>y</m>
          using a previous expression. 
        </p>
        <me>
          y = 1 + z = \frac{3}{2} 
        </me>
        <p>
          Finally, I can use this value for <m>y</m> to determine
          <m>x</m> using the first equation. 
        </p>
        <me>
          x = 1 - y = \frac{-1}{2}
        </me>
        <p>
          That gives me the full solution.

      </solution>
      <solution>
        <p>
          I have been given the area, but I need to know the perimeter.
          This is a square, so the area is the square of the side
          length. Since the area is <m>9m^2</m>, the side length must
          be <m>3m</m>, since <m>3^3 = 9</m>. There are four sides, each
          with length <m>3m</m>, so the total perimeter is <m>12m</m>.
          The planks are in <m>cm</m>, so I need to write <m>12m</m>
          as <m>1200cm</m>. Assume that the fence is built of planks
          that touch without any gaps, I can just divide the
          perimeter by the plank width.
          <me>
            \frac{1200}{15} = 80
          </me>
          I need 80 planks. It may not be necessary in the solution,
          but notice, also, that this gives 20 planks
          for each side, divided evenly, so I don't have to worry
          about using part of a plank for one side and part for
          another side.
