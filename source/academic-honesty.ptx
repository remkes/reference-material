  <title>Academic Honesty in Mathematics Courses</title>

    <title>General University Policy</title>
    <p>
      The rules of academic honesty for students are defined by
      university policy, described in the Calendar and summarized in
      all course syllabuses. The material here does not override or
      change anything in those policies. As students, you must be
      familiar with the expectations for academic honesty. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This document is specific to mathematics courses. It gives you
      some specific guidelines for mathematic work, assignments and
      exams. It tells you the specific expectation that I have for my
      students.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main point of this document is that mathematics is not
      fundamentally different from english, psychology, or any other
      university course in its expectations of academic honesty: you
      still have to produce your own work and credit your sources.
      This sometimes comes as a surprise, since many students seem to
      expect that mathematics is very different. It isn't. The same
      principles apply. This document gives some specifics of how to
      apply those principles. 
    </p>

  <section xml:id="section-assignments-purpose">
    <title>The Purpose of Assignments</title>
    <p>
      Most of the expectations in this section is about assignment,
      take-home exams, and any other mathematical work you submit. The
      principle here is simple. When you work, it must be your own
      work: your own thoughts, your own sentences, your own
      calculations. This is the point of an assignment. I don't set
      assignments because I need to mark something or I want to see
      correct answers on pieces of paper; I set assignments to
      encourage you to do the active work of solving mathematical
      problems, which is nearly the entire point of taking a
      mathematics course. I want each of you to actually do your
      assignments, since that's where some of the most important
      learning happens. All the expectations in this section flow from
      this principle. If you are wondering about 
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to doing your own work, it is an essential
      practice in academic work to give credit for what you have used
      from other people. You are not expected to work alone: there are
      many people, resources and tools that will help you complete
      mathematic work. You should use your resources. But you should
      give credit. If something is helpful to you, mention is, even if
      you are not quoting it directly. This is a habit of mind, a
      practice, a way of living in academic writing: we give credit
      because we are a community working together to understand the
      world. Because we can't do such a thing on our own but only with
      help.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you keep these two principle in mind, it's going to be very
      easy to meet these expectations. When you hand in an
      assignment, ask yourself: have I done my own work? have I given
      credit for the help I've received? If you have done both, then
      very likely you are already meeting my expectations. I'll
      elaborate in the following sections and you should read them
      carefully, but the are all details that try to show you how to
      follow these two basic ideas. 
    </p>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="section-working-with-people">
    <title>Working With Peoples</title>
    <p>
      Working in groups of classmates on assignments is excellent and
      highly encouraged. Mathematics is well suited to groups, where
      you can remind each other of ideas, correct each other's
      mistakes, and help each through conceptual barriers. Groups are
      great. However, at the end of your group work, you still have to
      produce your own assignment. You should never be copying,
      word-for-word or calculation-for-calculation, another student's
      assignment. Please work together: talk through the questions,
      check each other's work for errors, all these things. But please
      produce your own work at the end. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, getting help from people outside of your class is
      strongly encouraged. This includes friends, family members, and
      hired or volunteer tutors. Mathematics can be challenging, so if
      you have access to help from someone, then please take advantage
      of that help. The same general rule from the previous paragraph
      still applies: get help to understand the mathematics, but then
      do you own work. Don't let anyone else actually write your
      assignments for you -- that is cheating and is an academic
      honesty violation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some more notes about working with other people.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Obviously, you can't just copy another student's assignment or
        have a family member, friend or tutor write the assignment for
        you.  That's cheating, regardless of whether you had
        permission to copy. When you hand in an assignment, you are
        always implicitly saying that this work is your own work, that
        you've done it yourself. 
      </li>
      <li>
        If you work with a group, you still need to write your own
        assignments. Often your calculations will be nearly identical
        to your group, and that's to be expected (though you should
        always do your own calculations and understand them, not just
        copy someone else's calculations). Your sentences that
        surround your calculations, however, should not be the same
        sentences as any other student's. Write up your own work, use
        your own words to explain calculations and answer conceptual
        questions. 
      </li>
      <li>
        If you work with students in the class, note the names of the
        students you worked with at the end of your assignments. This
        is quite simple: just write, "On this assignments, I worked
        with NAME, NAME and NAME". This is appreciated since it gives
        credit for the help your received from your group. It also
        helps for marking; when assignments are very similar, if I
        can see that students worked together, that similarity is
        expected. (Identical assignments are still a problem, as
        discussed above). 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="section-external-resources">
    <title>External Teaching Resources</title>
    <p>
      There are many mathematics resources out in the world. There are
      books, of coures, but also explanatory YouTube videos, internet
      fora with problem solving advice, podcasts, and others. Using
      these resources to help can be really excellent. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The second main principle for this section is `give credit'.
        This is what I expect for external resources. If something
        from outside the course helps you, then please not it in your
        assignment. Be specific: if a video helped you understand a
        particular techinque that led to a solution of a particular
        problem, then say so on your assignments. I'm not particular
        about citation methods, but if you are citing online content,
        do always include the URL as well as the title of the content. 
      </li>
      <li>
        If you quote something directly, of course, you must cite
        this. Using something for help without quoting it directly is
        a gray area, but I would strongly encourage you to be in the
        habit of citing these as well. 
      </li>
      <li>
        It's possible you may find, somewhere in the world,  a
        solution to the exact problem that I have asked on an
        assignment. What do you do now? Well, you can quote that
        solution if you wish (with a citation of course). But the
        first principle of assignments is that their purpose is to
        help you actually understand the material. So, if you quote
        a solution from somewhere else, you then need to describe why
        that solution work and why you understand it. The point of an
        assignment is not to have a correct solution, but to
        demonstrate that you understand the solution and the process
        by which it was constructed. Make sure you do that
        demonstration. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, it is very important to know that mathematics is not
        perfectly consistent in its terminology and notation. Your
        external sources may use different terms and different
        symbols. This complicated external resources, since to use
        them you may need to learn new symbols and definitions, which
        can be difficult in itself. Also, in my courses you are
        required for use the notations and terminology that I set in
        the course. Therefore, if you learn from another source, you
        may have to translate from their symbols and terms back into
        those used in the course. This is required: work submitted
        using symbols and terms that different from the course will
        not be accepted. 
      </li>
    </ul>

  <section xml:id="section-computer-algebra-systems">
    <title>Computer Algebra Systems</title>
    <p>
      Computer algebra systems are a valuable and important tool in
      mathematics. This includes online tools like Desmos, Symbolal,
      Wolfram Alpha and many others. It also include programs like
      Mathematica, SageMath, R and again others.  There are several
      excellent uses of these tools
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Using these tools to check your work is great. Often, you can
        catch mistakes this way. However, do be aware that sometimes
        there are multiple presentations of the same correct answer --
        just because your answer differs does not always mean it is
        incorrect. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Using these tools to visualize mathematics, by drawing graphs
        and other shapes, it also great. I strongly encourage you to
        do this if it helps you understand problems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sometimes, in the specific rubrics, I will allow you to do
        various steps of a question by computer. When  I do this, then
        of course please use the appropriate computer algebra system
        to do these steps. This can save you a lot of time and
        trouble. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Like all resources, you need to give credit. For computer
        algebra system, you can simply me at the start of the
        assignment that you used a calculation tool and then very
        briefly indicated the places that it was used in the
        assignment. If you simply double checked your work with any of
        these tools, just say so as part of your citations. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, it is not acceptable to have a computer algebra
        system do all the work for you. Some of these systems are
        pretty good at producing solutions with all the steps and even
        with annotations. Going back to the first principle: the point
        of an assignment is to have you figure it out yourself, to
        understand yourself. Having a computer solve the question and
        just handing that in defeats the purpose of an assignment. You
        still need to do you own work. Handing in a computer-generated
        solution that you did not write is an academic honesty
        violate. 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="section-llms">
    <title>Large Language Models</title>
    <p>
      LLMs are the algorithms that make generative AI work: ChatGPT,
      DeepSeek, Gemini, parts of Alexa, Siri, Coplit, and many
      others. LLMs are the text generators, the pieces that actually
      take a prompts and produce the response text (or image, video,
      music, etc). Obviously, LLMs have quickly become a part of how
      many of us live and work. I have specific things to say about
      them as a tool in mathematics. 
    </p>
    <p>
      LLMs can imitate two things I've already talked about:
      educational resources and computer algebra systems. If you ask
      them, they will produce both explanation of mathematics and
      answers to specific calculations. First, then, the same
      general principles apply. Having an LLM do you work for you
      defeats the purpose of an assignment. Just like it was for
      other tools, this is an academic honesty offense. 
    </p>
    <p>
      So what about using LLMs in place of other resources or
      calculation tools, in the appropriate ways I've described
      above? The answer to this depends on the course. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In courses where assignments are graded normally, the use of
        LLMs are resources is prohibited. 
      </li>
      <li>
        In courses where assignments are graded just on completion,
        the use of LLMS is not prohibit but it is very strongly
        discouraged. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Why this policy? It's because of the nature of how an LLM works.
      And LLM is a statistical pattern matching machines. It produces
      text that it things matches the patterns of all that has read in
      its training. What it can do with these patterns is pretty
      incredible, for sure. But it is all about patterns of what is in
      the training data. It's not at all about what is true or correct
      -- that's not what an LLM is designed to do. 
    </p>
    <p>
      LLMs are pretty good these days at getting information right by
      accident. If you ask first-year level mathematics quesitons,
      you'll get correct information much of the time. But not always,
      since generating things that are verifyable true is not was an
      LLM is for. Therefore, they are unreliable. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you ask an LLM to explain a math concept, its explanation may
      just be wrong. That's of no help to a student, particular since
      you don't know when it is accurate. Therefore, for conceptual
      questions, you should rely on known sources: text written by
      reputable mathematicians, videos by the same, and so on. The
      source is important. You need to know that this information was
      generated by a person who knows the mathematics and intends to
      share it with the world accurately. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, if you ask an LLM to do a math calculations, it might
      just do it wrong. I doesn't have a mathematical logic in it,
      it's just predicting text. It will get many calcluations
      correct, but far from all of them. Instead, you would ask a
      computer algebra system, as discussed above. These are programed
      with the logic of mathematics in them, and will consistently
      generate correct calculations. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is my reasoning for either prohibiting or very strongly
      disouraging LLMs. Please take this to hear and make use of other
      resources. 
    </p>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="section-exams">
    <title>Exams</title>
    <p>
      In some courses, I assign take-home tests or exams.  These are
      very much like assignments, but they have different
      expectations. Unlike assignments, where working together and
      getting help are encouraged, I expect you to do the tests
      entirely on your own. Don't talk to your classmates or anyone
      else about the questions: do what you can with your own
      resources. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is easy: simply don't talk about the exam until you
      have submitted it. If you follow this clear instruction,
      everything is great.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the discussion about online sources still apply to the
      take-home tests. You are welcome to use sources, such as
      videos and online text (with citations, of course), to help you
      with the concepts and ideas of the course which relate to the
      test. It is not acceptable to post test questions anywhere
      online. Use of LLMs is prohibited.
