    <title>General University Policy</title>
    <p>
      The rules of academic honesty for students are defined by
      university policy, described in the Calendar and summarized in
      all course syllabuses. The material here does not override or
      change anything in those policies. As students, you must be
      familiar with the expectations for academic honesty. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This document is specific to mathematics courses. It gives you
      some specific guidelines for mathematic work, assignments and
      exams. It tells you the specific expectation that I have for my
      students.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main point of this document is that mathematics is not
      fundamentally different from english, psychology, or any other
      university course in its expectations of academic honesty: you
      still have to produce your own work and credit your sources.
      This sometimes comes as a surprise, since many students seem to
      expect that mathematics is very different. It isn't. The same
      principles apply. This document gives some specifics of how to
      apply those principles.

    <title>Submitted Mathematical Work</title>
    <p>
      This section is about assignment, take-home exams, and any other
      mathematical work you submit. The principle here is simple. When
      you work, it must be your own work: your own thoughts, your own
      sentences, your own calculations. This is the point of an
      assignment. I don't set assignments because I need to mark
      something; I set assignments to encourage you to do the active
      work of solving mathematical problems, which is nearly the
      entire point of taking a mathematics course. I want each of you
      to actually do your assignments, since that's where some of the
      most important learning happens.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, working in groups on assignments is excellent and
      highly encouraged. Mathematics is well suited to groups, where
      you can remind each other of ideas, correct each other's
      mistakes, and help each through conceptual barriers. Groups are
      great. However, at the end of your group work, you still have to
      produce your own assignment. You should never be copying,
      word-for-word or calculation-for-calculation, another student's
      assignment. Please work together: talk through the questions,
      check each other's work for errors, all these things. But please
      produce your own work at the end. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I have produced a list that summarizes the specifics of my
      assignment expectations for academic honesty. (This list repeats
      some of the expectations in <xref
      ref="chapter-how-to-write-an-assignment" />, but elaborates more
      on the academic honesty pieces.)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Obviously, you can't just copy another student's assignment.
        That's cheating, regardless of whether you had permission to
        copy. Given that you are reading this, I'm assuming
        that you are, in fact, trying to do your work honestly. 
      </li>
      <li>
        If you work with a group, you still need to write your own
        assignments. Often your calculations will be nearly identical
        to your group, and that's to be expected (though you should
        always do your own calculations and understand them, not just
        copy someone else's calculations). Your sentences that
        surround your calculations, however, should not be the same
        sentences as any other student's. Write up your own work, use
        your own words to explain calculations and answer conceptual
        questions. 
      </li>
      <li>
        If you work with students in the class, note the names of the
        students you worked with at the end of your assignments. This
        is quite simple: just write, "On this assignments, I worked
        with NAME, NAME and NAME". This is appreciated since it gives
        credit for the help your received from your group. It also
        helps for marking; when assignments are very similar, if I
        can see that students worked together, that similarity is
        expected. (Identical assignments are still a problem, as
        discussed above). 
      </li>
      <li>
        It's fine if someone else (a friend, a family member, a tutor,
        etc) helps you with an assignment. However, it is not
        acceptable if they do the questions for you. They should help
        you figure out how do to the problem, often by working through
        the main concepts and similar examples problems, and then you
        should do the problems on your own and write up your solutions
        on your own.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you used another book (article, etc.), you must cite that
        book just as you would in an English course. You may use any
        citation style.
      </li>
      <li>
        I'll talk about the use of internet resources in the next
        section, since that topic deserves its own section. 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="section-internet-resources">
    <title>Internet Resources</title>
    <p>
      I know that many of you will do the majority of your mathematics
      work with a browser open. That's fine, and the internet is full
      of some amazing resources. But you have to be clear and careful
      about how you use online resources. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First and foremost, you have to cite what you use. Any
        websites, videos, calculation tools that you use for an
        assignment should be cited somewhere in your assignment. I
        find this expectation is often surprising to many
        students, but I'm serious. Internet resources are like any
        resources, and for academic writing, we cite our resources. We
        do this to give credit, since those who produced all these
        websites are helping us do our work. 
      </li>
      <li>
        These citations should be specific as reasonable. Don't
        vaguely say that you used Youtube or even Khan Academy; tell me
        specifically which video you watched that helped you and give
        me the URL. (When you submit a scanned PDF of written work,
        you can use the online text field in Moodle to submit your
        reference, if you wish, so that you don't have to copy our
        complicated URLs in pen and paper.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Online calculation tools (Wolfram Alpha, Demos, Symbolab, and
        many others) are great. Feel free to use them to do
        calculations and to check your work. However, like all
        resources, you need to give credit. For calculation tools like
        these (and any other computer algebra systems), you can tell
        me at the start of the assignment that you used a calculation
        tool and then very briefly indicated the places that it was
        used in the assignment. If you simply double checked your work
        with any of these tools, just say so as part of your
        citations. Even if you do use these tools for calculation or
        checking, you still need to show enough work to make it clear
        that you understand the processes. 
      </li>
      <li>
        In the above discussion, I am talking about sources without
        in-person interaction, such as online texts, encylopedias,
        video explanations, and calculation tools. The
        internet also has interactive sources: various places where
        you can ask for math help and receive responses from actual
        people to your specific questions. Some of these are free and
        some are paid serivces. I want to be very clear
        about my expectation for these kind of sites.
        <blockquote>
          It's fine to ask general questions on a math forum or help
          site.  Some like <dq>I need help figuring out how to solve
          systems of equations</dq> is very reasonable. If you want
          specific examples to ask about, use the activities in the
          course and ask people to help you understand the activities.
          However, please DO NOT post any assignment questions or
          take-home exam questions to any online math forum or help
          site. I need to draw a clear line here, so that it is easy
          for you to understand my expectations. Posting assignment
          questions or exam questions online is not acceptable. 
      </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        Often when students look online for material from the course,
        they will find similar material which differs in notations,
        definitions, or solution methods. Similarly, you may have
        previous mathematical experience that uses slightly different
        notations, definition or method. I have two important
        instructions for these situations.
        <blockquote>
          If you know another way of doing a problem, you need to
          explain to me, in the assignment, why your method works.
          Anything that comes from outside the course needs context:
          you can't just use another method and expect me to
          understand what you are doing. You need to explain.

          Even if you know a different notation, I insist that you
          translate your knowledge and practice into the notation I
          use in the course. You must submit your assignment following
          the notational conventions I introduces in the videos and
          the notes. 
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        Two specific internet resources require their own specific
        nows. First, Wikipedia is not an authoratative source for
        quotationes. Wikipedia is an immensely useful source and a
        great place to look for reminders and concepts. I frequently
        use it informally to help remember various pieces of
        mathematics. But you can't use it as an authority; you can't
        claim that any definition, notation or method is correct
        because you read it on Wikipedia. If you want to do this, look
        for waht Wikipedia uses as souces and track those down, so
        that you can find a reasonable citation. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
        Last, but not least, I need to talk about predictive language
        models: GPT and its friends on other platforms. Predictive
        language models can be a pretty fantastic resource, and it is
        certainly amazing what they can accomplish. I imagine that we
        are only just starting to understand it implications. So, what
        are the expectation for using it in mathematics courses? Well,
        it depends on what you do with it.
        </p>
        <p>
        You could ask a predictive language model to write your
        assignment text for you. However, recall what I wrote
        previously: when you submit work, I expect what you submit
        your own work: your own thoughts, your own sentences.
        Therefore, in my courses, you are not permitted to have a
        predictive language model write your assignment text for you.
        </p>
        <p>
        You could ask it to check your calculations for you; some
        language models are pretty good at math calculations.
        However, I discourage this usage as well. Above, I encouraged
        you to use Wolfram Alpha, Symbolab, Desmos and other online
        calculation tool. If you are going to use a computer for
        calcuation,  I suggest these. Why not use GPT or another
        language model? Well, because they are language models: they
        are designed to mimic language. They don't, fundamentally,
        have either the goal or the design for accuracy in answers.
        They'll produce something that looks and sounds like
        reasonable mathematics, but it might simply be totally wrong.
        </p> 
        <p>
        Lastly, if you do use GPT or another language model in some
        other way, you do have to cite it. King's has decided, as a
        policy for all courses, that use of language model text
        without citation does, in fact, constitute plagiarism. This is
        a serious academic offence with serious reprocusions. Even if
        you unsure about the two previous point and do end up trying
        to use a language model, at the very least give your source. 
        </p>

  <section xml:id="section-exams">
    <title>Exams</title>
    <p>
      In some courses, I assign take-home tests or exams.  These are
      very much like assignments, but they have different
      expectations. Unlike assignments, where working together and
      getting help are encouraged, I expect you to do the tests
      entirely on your own. Don't talk to your classmates or anyone
      else about the questions: do what you can with your own
      resources. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is easy: simply don't talk about the exam until you
      have submitted it. If you follow this clear instruction,
      everything is great.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the discussion about online sources still apply to the
      take-home tests. You are welcome to use static sources, such as
      videos and online text (with citations, of course), to help you
      with the concepts and ideas of the course which relate to the
      test. It is not acceptable to post test questions anywhere
      online.
